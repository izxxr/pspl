# PSPL
**P**seudocode **S**tyled **P**rogramming **L**anguage is a simple and experimental programming language used for educational and learning purposes.

As the name suggests, the syntax of PSPL is inspired from [CIE styled pseudocode](https://pdfcoffee.com/9618-pseudocode-guide-for-teachers-for-examination-from-2021-pdf-free.html).
This language is an experimental side project for evaluating simple pseudocode. In other words, this language can be considered a superset of CIE styled pseudocode.
